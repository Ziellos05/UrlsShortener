### App that allows shorting a long URL and saves it in a database for any logged user. 

This project have to branches:

1. backend: Where the magic happens, this app allows connections and is the middle layer between the frontend and the database, here you can create shortened URLs, but not duplicate fields, and here is where you read the origin of the lil url to return to the original web page, if this page doesn't exists, redirects to google main page.

3. frontend: I am the kind of guy that loves a black and white screen with a lot of characters, but this front is a useful and pretty interactive view that allows an user login using its google account and lets you create your new shortened urls, besides watching a historial of previous created URLs.
